# Future releases

Below a list of features to be released:

### Hebrew Accents   

Currently, all Hebrew accents are part of the group **is_hbr_accent()**.
However, this group can again be further subdivided into smaller groups.
To realize this, a number of new functions will be added in the future.

NOTE:  All future releases will be backwords compatible.
